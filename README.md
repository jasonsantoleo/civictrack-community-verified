## The Problem

The fundamental problem is the breakdown of trust in the civic reporting process. Citizens feel their reports on issues like road damage or garbage overflow are shouts into a void. On the other side, municipal authorities are swamped with unreliable, unverified data. This creates a vicious cycle of apathy and inaction.

## Our Solution

CivicTrack is a mobile-first web application that transforms the standard "complaint box" into a verifiable ledger of real-world problems.

We achieve this through a smart, achievable, and powerful system of **Geofenced Community Consensus**. An issue is only marked as `VERIFIED` after a second community member, physically present at the location, confirms its existence. Every action creates an immutable, timestamped record, building a trusted dataset for both citizens and city officials.

## Core Features (MVP for Today's Sprint)

- [ ] **User Authentication:** Secure login and registration.
- [ ] **Report New Issue:** Submit an issue with a title, description, photo, and GPS coordinates.
- [ ] **Interactive Map View:** Display all reported issues as pins on a map of Chennai.
- [ ] **(Killer Feature) Geofenced Verification:** Prompt nearby users to validate new, unverified reports.
- [ ] **Real-time Status Updates:** Map pins change instantly as an issue's status is updated (e.g., from `UNVERIFIED` to `VERIFIED`).
- [ ] **Transparent Issue Ledger:** View the complete, timestamped history of any issue.
