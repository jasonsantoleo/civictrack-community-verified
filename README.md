## The Problem

The fundamental problem is the breakdown of trust in the civic reporting process. Citizens feel their reports on issues like road damage or garbage overflow are shouts into a void. On the other side, municipal authorities are swamped with unreliable, unverified data. This creates a vicious cycle of apathy and inaction.

## Our Solution

CivicTrack is a mobile-first web application that transforms the standard "complaint box" into a verifiable ledger of real-world problems.

We achieve this through a smart, achievable, and powerful system of **Geofenced Community Consensus**. An issue is only marked as `VERIFIED` after a second community member, physically present at the location, confirms its existence. Every action creates an immutable, timestamped record, building a trusted dataset for both citizens and city officials.

## Key Features

- [x] **Secure User Authentication:** Polished sign-up and login flow.
- [x] **New Issue Reporting:** Submit issues with a title, description, photo, and GPS location (with a map-center fallback).
- [x] **Interactive Map View:** Displays all issues on a map of Chennai with custom, color-coded pins.
- [x] **Image Previews:** View reported images directly in the map popups.
- [x] **Geofenced Community Verification:** The "killer feature" prompts nearby users to validate new, unverified reports.
- [x] **Real-Time Updates:** The map updates instantly for all users using Supabase Broadcast when issues are reported or verified.
- [x] **Robust Security:** Full database and storage security implemented with Row Level Security (RLS) policies.
